# ChassiDex Database

ChassiDex database is the first project by the ChassiDex team, dedicated to making synthetic biology host agnostic.

The project is currently hosted [here](https://suspicious-curran-f3ddc7.netlify.com/)

This is a database of basic information about various organisms to get you started - from the preferred medium and growth conditions, to available vectors and transformation protocols. 

With ChassiDex, we hope to encourage beginning researchers to experiment with organisms other than the popular and well characterized *E. coli* - to explore better and more well-suited organisms, and thereby also learn more about them.

ChassiDex was designed by Team IIT-Madras, participating in iGEM 2017. Please check out our [wiki](http://2017.igem.org/Team:IIT-Madras) and feel free to mail us with feedback or suggestions at chassidex@gmail.com
