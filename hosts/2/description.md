The description starts here. The whole thing is written in Markdown. It's really simple. A heading starts with a '#' followed by a space as you can see below. References are simple. [^somename]. By the way, *some random* latin name can be written in italics *like this*.

# Strains
This section lists common strains of the species and their specific uses. Lists are simple:
1. Strain 1[^strainref1]
2. Strain 2[^strainref2]
3. Each strain can have a description too

# Growth Characteristics
In this section, provide information about the optimal conditions and nutritional requirements for growth and reproduction of the host. Include data such as optimal temperature, pH and doubling time. Please provide your references.

# Culture Suppliers
In this section please provide links to culture sources from which one may obtain a culture of the organism. This may include culture collections such as ATCC, or research labs that are willing to share the organism.

1. ATCC: [https://www.atcc.org/](https://www.atcc.org/)
2. MTCC: [https://www.mtccindia.res.in/](https://www.mtccindia.res.in/)

That's how you put links.

# Maintenance Protocols
